I became a CS student specifically because of my life-long interest in Computers. Back when my dad built my first pc (which was around 2009-2010 or when I was 6 years old), I would often use it to watch videos or play popular games online. I would always think to myself, "I want to get into a career related to Computers!". However, I didn't know exactly what I would want to do then.

It wasn't until high school that I knew what major I wanted to go into. Initially, I took CS classes thinking that I would learn just about computer parts, how they work, and how computers are made, but I was wrong. In my first CS class, I learned about HTMl, Javascript, and how to code websites and browser games. I enjoyed that class! And it was then, that I realized I wanted to go into Computer Science. So, I kept taking whatever CS classes my high school Niles West, offered, and aspired to get good grades in all of my classes. It all payed off in the end because I got As in all of my classes, and scored well on my AP courses. I ended up scoring a 5 in AP Computer Science A.

After graduating high school, I started taking more CS classes at my college, UIC. As a CS student studying in college, I was constantly hands on with projects and assignments given from all my classes, especially CS. There wasn't a day where I wasn't doing anything related to CS; I was always working on coding projects given by my CS classes and was able to improve my proficiency in a variety of programming languages. In my free time, I like to learn other programming languages: Ruby and SQL.
